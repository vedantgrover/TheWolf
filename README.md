# TheWolf

Welcome to the Wolf's Github Repo! This bot is used for the JHS CSHS server!
My name is Freyr (on Discord) and I have been working on Discord bots for 2 years now!
Super excited to be a part of this project and hopefully I can make your experience on this
server enjoyable!

This bot is a full multipurpose bot, including things from Moderation to Economy!

I am beyond excited to start making bots again. I hope you enjoy!!
